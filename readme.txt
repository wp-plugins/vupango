VuPango allows for the setup of remote art installations involving multiple cameras

== Description ==

VuPango is an exciting step in the democratization of media, giving you remote video connectivity that once only belonged to mammoth corporations. VuPango lets you add multiple simultaneous live streams of video to your Blog.  These videos can come from web cams or from cell phones anywhere in the world, with the video locations shown on a Google map. The videos are automatically arranged in a grid in the format of your choosing. There is also automatic implementation for twitter. This plugin is ideal for artists, performers, activists or anyone who wants to create a synchronous event from worldwide locations with live video. Join the revolution.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `vupango` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where is my VuPango page? =

VuPango's page is treated exactly like any other page on your Wordpress site and can be found in the Pages section of the Admin Panel. If your theme supports it, it will also be listed in your navigation by default.

= The streams aren't displaying at the proper times, what's wrong? =

Make sure that you have entered your timezone in Wordpress' General Settings. It's important that you pick a city in your timezone so that DST can be calculated correctly.

= What is open signup? =

Open signup allows people to sign up through the VuPango page on your wordpress site.

= How can I totally delete VuPango without leaving a trace? =

In VuPango's settings, select 'Destroy data on deactivation' and then deactivate VuPango from the Plugins menu.

= Can I edit the camera stream data? =

Unfortunately, that is not possible in this version. To edit a stream, simply delete it and re-enter it as a new camera stream.
